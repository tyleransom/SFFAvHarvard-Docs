There is a document filed on July 30, 2020 called "APPENDIX filed by Appellant Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. [19-2006]" which has 9 volumes (6,295 pages). Those volumes include every single declaration, exhibit, deposition transcript, demonstrative, etc. that was unsealed as part of the lawsuit. There should be a helpful table of contents that maps between exhibits and joint appendix pages.
